# Practicum Project NLP Pipeline for Unstructured Cinical Data 

The model directory cotains a file with the model weights that can be used to load the mode and the encoder file from sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder() to map model out outs to ICD-10 codes.

The data directory contains test data in the form of a csv with cinical notes and their matching ICD-10 diagnosis from the MIMIC-III dataset. 

The XLNet_Model.ipynb was used to create and train the model.
