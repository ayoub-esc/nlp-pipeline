   Additional Information:
   Patient / Family Assessment: Met briefly with pt who said that she was
   tired and did not want to talk. When told that this worker wanted to
   see how she was doing re her medical problems, viz., her breast CA, at
   which point she did start talking about her concerns. She feared that
   they would find that she has CA in both breasts. Ms. [**Known lastname **] said that
   she would not allow them to use dye related to doing a biopsy, because
   she ""would die."" It appears that previously she had a major allergic
   reaction. She is followed by a SW in [**Company 319**]. The pt could only remember
   that her first name, [**Doctor First Name 20**]. When asked if she wanted this writer to
   contact the SW to let her know of her hospitalization, she said no,
   that she would call tomorrow. When asked if there were people to whom
   she could turn to for support, she said yes, but did not say anymore
   other than the fact that she likes people. Some of the pt's
   reservations about talking may have been because she thought this
   worker would be asking about her EtOH use; because she was not queried
   may explain why she talked as much as she did. When talking about her
   breast CA, pt's eyes became teary, but because of the tenuousness of
   this brief contact, it felt premature to talk about her affect.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2165-2-28**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size. Mild global LV
hypokinesis. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Mild global RV free wall
hypokinesis. Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior cardiac surgery.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR well seated, normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Trace AR. [The amount of AR
is normal for this AVR.]

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet. No PS.
Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm).

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45%), with
slightly more prominent septal hypokinesis in the setting of tachycardia. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and
transvalvular gradients. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. [The amount of
regurgitation present is normal for this prosthetic aortic valve.] The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No significant pericardial effusion seen. Mild global
biventricular systolic dysfunction. Normally-functioning aortic valve
prosthesis. Mild mitral and regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-2-28**], biventricular
function is less vigorous, however the patient is significantly more
tachycardic today. Regurgitant aortic valve has been replaced with a
prosthesis.","CVICU
