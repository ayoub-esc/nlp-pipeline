The purpose of this project is turn unstructured clinical data into a meaningful encoding. The project will focus on ingesting and preprocessing clinical notes, then applying an NLP transformation layer to predict ICD-10 diagnosis code for patients from each clinical note. The final web application will provide an interface to upload either a singular clinical note in a text field or upload a CSV file of multiple clinical notes. The output will be either the predicted ICD-10 diagnosis code or a CSV file of all the predictions in the case of multiple patient clinical notes were provided.
